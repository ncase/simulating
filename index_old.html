		Note: It looks like your browser doesn't support emoji,

		It's not 🌟full-color🌟 emoji, but oh well.
		Such is life.

	<p>
		So, I used to live in California.
		Back then, it was going through a rough season of droughts, water shortages, and wildfires.
		It's still going on, actually.
		These problems involve a messy mix of
		environmental, economic, and political systems...
		all of which came together to create the
		perfect lack-of-rain-let-alone-a-storm.
	</p>
	<p>
		Point is, our world is run by complex systems.
		We may feel helpless to change them or understand them...

		<b>think in systems</b>.

	<p>
		That’s where simulations come in!
		It’s easier to understand a system if you can <i>see</i> the system,
		or better yet, <i>play</i> with the system.
		So today, I’d like to share with you some simple simulations of the world...
		made in emoji. 🌲🌲🌲

<!-- 1: INTRODUCTION - SYSTEMS THEORY, PREDICT CHANGE -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		As it turns out, forest firefighters <i>already</i> use computer simulations
		to tackle wildfires, <i>in real time</i>!
		And it’s not just firefighters.
		With the help of simulations, a growing group of scientists
		from different disciplines have discovered a few strange things about the systems of our world.
	</p>
	<p>
		First, <b>emergence</b>:
		complex systems can arise from simple rules.
		This is how a few chess rules can give us infinite play,
		and how these tiny emoji sims can capture real complexity.
	</p>
	<p>
		Second, <i>all complex systems have things in common</i>.
		So in a way... Financial crises are like forest fires.
		Terrorist groups are like termite colonies.
		Pandemics are like a GIF people won't stop spreading.
		Since you can learn a few core lessons about <i>all</i> systems from <i>any</i> system,
		let’s stick with our forest sim, and add one more rule:
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		🌲→🔥 Trees sometimes get hit by lightning &amp; catch on fire.
	</p>
	<p>
		Sims can help <i>explain</i> a system,
		but they're also great for <i>exploring</i> systems.
		Experimentation.
		Asking, <i>“what if?”</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		For example, <i>what</i> do you think would happen now,
		<i>if</i> you increased tree growth? (empty→🌲)
		What behavior would <i>emerge?</i>
		Don’t worry, you're not being judged or graded,
		this is only for you to express your prediction:
	</p>
	<p>
	<form name="predict_fire" class="reader_choice">

		Neither.
	</label>
	<label>
		<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="both">
		Both... somehow.
	</label>
	</form>
	</p>
	<p>
		And now, you get to run that experiment.
	</p>
</div>

<!-- 1: WHAT IF, HIGHER GROWTH? -->

<!-- 2: REFLECT, AND FEEDBACK LOOPS -->
<div class="words">
	<p name="predict_fire" class="reader_reflect">

		<span value="more">
		Ah, you predicted that higher tree growth would lead to more trees.
		That’s an intuitive and obvious choice,
		so of course, it’s wrong.
		That’s because more trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="less">
		Ah, you predicted that more trees would lead to <i>fewer</i> trees!
		Clever. However, that’s only half-true!
		I assume you figured out that more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but you forgot that <i>afterwards</i>,
		fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="none">
		Heh, you must’ve thought I was giving you a trick question.
		I mean, I was, but still.
		Anyway, more trees → fire can spread further → fewer trees...
		but <i>then</i>, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → more trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

		<span value="both">
		You predicted that you’d get both more trees <i>and</i> fewer trees?
		That doesn’t make sense, it’s a contradiction,
		so of course, you’re totally right!
		More trees → fire can spread further → <i>fewer</i> trees...
		but then, fewer trees → fire spreads less → trees can grow back → <i>more</i> trees, repeat.
		And the more growth, the faster this birth-death-rebirth cycle spins.
		</span>

	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉→🌲📈⟲
	</p>
	<p>
		This is <i>thinking in systems</i>.
		See, we’re so used to thinking in linear cause-and-effect, A-changes-B.
		But most of the world is filled with what scientists call <b>feedback loops</b>,
		where A-changes-B-changes-A-changes-B, and so on.
	</p>
	<p>
		One kind of feedback loop is the <b>reinforcing loop</b>,
		when more gets you even more.
		For example, in our simulation, fire creates more fire.
		This kind of loop tends to create <i>tipping points</i>,
		where a small change gets amplified over and over until it
		completely alters the whole system.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		more leads to more:<br>
		🔥📈→🔥📈
	</p>
	<p>
		Another kind of loop is the <b>balancing loop</b>,
		when more leads to <i>less</i>.
		Balancing loops stop reinforcing loops from growing to infinity.
		Like how fire makes more fire, but can’t go on forever,
		because it'll run out of trees to burn, and so, results in less fire.
		This kind of loop leads to <i>stability</i>,
		because it tends to undo change.
	</p>
	<p style="text-align:center">
		more leads to less:<br>
		🔥📈→🌲📉→🔥📉
 	</p>
	<p>
		This is why we’re so bad at handling complex issues.
		Everyone’s looking for the root cause,
		but if causality is not linear, but <i>loopy</i>,
		then there <i>is</i> no root cause!
	</p>
	<p>
		That doesn’t mean we can’t still solve problems.
		Simulations let us do experiments that would be impractical or impossible to try out for realsies.
		For example, in this next experiment,
		you're going to help trees grow,
		<i>by killing trees</i>.
		Stop.
		Think for a moment.
		How could that even be possible?
		Now.
		Let's do it.
	</p>
</div>

<!-- 2: CREATE A TREE-KILLING SOLUTION -->
<div class="example">
	<div id="title">
		<b>A Forest</b> Where You Show Trees No Mercy
	</div>
	<iframe src="model?local=forest/2_firebreak&edit=1&paused=1"></iframe>
	<div id="example_link"></div>
</div>

<!-- 3: CHANGING LOOPS, AND PLANTS -->
<div class="words">
	<p>
		Think about how counterintuitive that is,
		helping trees by killing trees.
		Well, forest firefighters actually do this!
		They make “firebreaks” by removing small trees, underbrush, and other flammable shtuff,
		to stop wildfires from spreading through.
		This breaks the reinforcing loop of 🔥📈→🔥📈,
		and reduces the balancing loop of 🌲📈→🔥📈→🌲📉.
	</p>
	<p>
		<i>That</i> is how you change a system.
		Not by fighting symptoms or pushing numbers,
		but by <i>changing the core loops.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		Now that you've gotten a taste of thinking in systems,
		let's do a couple final experiments.
		A forest wouldn’t be an ecosystem with just one species,
		so let’s simulate a forest with these two plants:
	</p>
	<p>
		🌳 <b>Strong Tree:</b>
		Invincible to fire, but if it’s surrounded by four or more Jerk Trees,
		it'll be choked of nutrients and die.
	</p>
	<p>
		🌱 <b>Jerk Tree:</b>
		Invasive species.
		Flammable &amp; grows twice as fast as the Strong Tree.
		Also sometimes bursts into flames.
	</p>
	<p>
		I’ve balanced it so that, normally,
		these plants would get a 50/50 split of the land.
		But <i>after you create firebreaks</i>,
		what do you think will happen?
		(think <i>loopy</i>: what feedback loops do you change?
		what would emerge from those changes?)
	</p>
	<p>
		<form name="predict_plants_1" class="reader_choice">
		<label>
			<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="same" checked>
			🌳=🌱: They’ll still have an even split.

		</label>
		<label>
			<input type="radio" name="prediction" value="what">
			Something completely different.
		</label>
		</form>
	</p>
	<p>
		And just for kicks, let’s also do the complete opposite.
		Instead of firebreaks, what would happen if you
		<i>kept setting random parts of the forest on fire?</i>
	</p>
	<p>

			document.getElementById("smokey_joke_radio").setAttribute("disabled",true);

<div class="words">
	<p>
		Did you notice how, in the normal case, the plants formed clusters
		even though <i>no rule told them to?</i>
		Scientists call this <b>self-organization.</b>
		This is when order emerges from the <i>bottom up,</i>
		contrary to the popular belief
		that order must always come from the <i>top down.</i>
		Self-organization also means a system
		automatically <b>adapts</b> to new scenarios,
		for better or worse.
		Which brings us to your predictions...
	</p>
	<p name="predict_plants_1" class="reader_reflect">
		<span value="same">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would <i>not</i> affect the ratio of plants, which is an understandable guess! However, in an interconnected system, changing one part usually changes all the others, thanks to self-organization. Here, walls limit fire, fire limits Jerks, and Jerks limit Strongs.
		</span>
		<span value="strong">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would help the Strong Tree win. I assume you guessed that if firebreaks made the <i>forest</i> more fireproof, it should make the <i>trees</i> more fireproof, too. However, thanks to self-organization, the whole is <i>completely different</i> from the sum of its parts. So while your walls <i>did</i> lead to less fire, less fire means more Jerks, and more Jerks mean less Strongs.
		</span>
		<span value="jerk">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought your firebreaks would let the Jerk Tree win. And you were totally correct! Your walls limit fire, fire limits Jerks, and Jerks limit Strongs. Let’s stop to appreciate that you held <i>three different system relationships in your head</i>, and accurately predicted how they would self-organize!
		</span>
		<span value="what">
		PREDICTION #1: you thought the plants would do something nuts. Maybe you thought they’d cycle back and forth, like an earlier sim did. However, because the Strong Tree doesn’t affect fire <i>or</i> Jerks, there’s no loop there, and thus no Jerk-Strong cycle. (There <i>are</i> other loops, though) Instead, what happened was: your walls led to less fire, less fire meant more Jerks, and more Jerks meant less Strongs. That’s how they self-organized.
		</span>

	<p style="text-align:center">
		🔥📉→🌱📈→🌳📉
	</p>
	<p name="predict_plants_2" class="reader_reflect">
		<span value="same">
		PREDICTION #2: you thought setting stuff on fire would not change the plant ratio. But instead, more fire led to Strong Trees winning, and therefore, <i>less</i> fire. Paradoxical. What happened is same logic as before, except with “more” and “less” <i>flipped around:</i>
		</span>
		<span value="strong">
		PREDICTION #2: you thought setting stuff on fire would help the Strong Tree win. And, you’re right! Not only that, adding more fire also leads to <i>less</i> fire in the long run, paradoxically. It’s the same logic as before, except with “more” and “less” <i>flipped around:</i>
		</span>
		<span value="jerk">
		PREDICTION #2: you thought setting stuff on fire would let the Jerk Tree win. And that seems like it should make sense, wouldn’t a more flammable forest have more flammable trees?

		You might be skeptical about these results.
		And I hope you are! It’s good to be critical!
		I mean, this sim is basically saying 
		<i>fire is good for the forest</i>.
		That can't be right, can it?
	</p>
	<p>
		🌲But consider the Jack Pine.
		Its pine cones are sealed with wax,
		and can't release its seeds until <i>a forest fire melts the wax away</i>.
		Our hypothetical Strong Tree was merely <i>immune</i> to wildfires.
		The Jack Pine, one of many fire-dependent trees,
		is <i>born</i> out of fire — much like the legendary Phoenix.
	</p>
	<p>
		🔥Also, consider that Native Americans and Australian Aboriginals
		used to <i>deliberately</i> set fires,
		under safe weather conditions,
		to maintain forest diversity and stability.
		In contrast, the U.S. Forest Service once decreed
		that <i>all</i> fires must be put out by 10 a.m. the next day,
		which backfired (haha),
		and might've made forests unhealthier in the long run.
		To this day, there's still heated debate (haha)
		over if we should let more fires burn,
		or even <i>actively set fires.</i>
	</p>
	<p>
		🏠Heck, <i>I’m</i> also skeptical if we should set more fires.
		There are legitimate concerns about
		smoke,
		soil damage,
		and escaped fire accidentally burning people’s houses down.
	</p>
	<p>
		These are complex problems, and there'll never be One Best Solution.
		But that’s exactly why we gotta think in systems,
		not just to tackle wildfires,
		but <i>all</i> the global challenges we face.
	</p>
	<p>
		So here's <b>a gallery of simulations</b>,
		modeling some of our world's biggest problems.
		Now, don't just take my sims at face value.
		Think critically. Play critically.
		Challenge my assumptions by changing the rules.
		Create solutions I haven't even <i>thought</i> of.
		Come up with experiments, predict what would happen, then try 'em.

				<p style="margin-bottom:35px">
				This whole thing was a very, <i>very</i> incomplete introduction to
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems" target="_blank">complexity science.</a>
				I’ll admit, it’s a young science.
				Still growing up, figuring out its own identity, going through science-puberty.
				But I think it’s potentially revolutionary, so if you’d like to learn more,
				here’s some of my favorite reads:
				</p>

				<p class="further_book">
				<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Thinking-Systems-Donella-H-Meadows/dp/1603580557" target="_blank">
					<img src="styles/books/thinking.png"/>
					Thinking In Systems</a>
				<b>(Donella Meadows, 2008)</b>
				<span style="display:block; height:5px"></span>
				Here’s where it all started for me.
				This book was what first got me to see the world in loops,
				and ever since I read it,
				I <i>hungered</i> for complex systems.
				Hence, why I devoured the following books.
				</p>

				<p class="further_book">
				<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8429.html" target="_blank">
					<img src="styles/books/cas.png"/>
					Complex Adaptive Systems</a>
				<b>(Miller &amp; Page, 2007)</b>
				<span style="display:block; height:5px"></span>
				This one’s slightly more technical, but still very accessibly written.
				With this book, I unlearnt my top-down mindset,
				and saw how systems grow <i>from the bottom up.</i>
				</p>

				<p class="further_book">
				<a href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/growing-artificial-societies" target="_blank">
					<img src="styles/books/gas.png"/>
					Growing Artificial Societies</a>
				<b>(Epstein &amp; Axtell, 1996)</b>
				<span style="display:block; height:5px"></span>
				Totally not accessible for a general audience, but still really cool.
				In this book, the authors take “from the bottom up” to the <i>extreme</i> — step by step,
				they build up a single, unified simulation of
				population, culture, conflict, economics, and disease!
				Woah.
				</p>

				<p class="further_book">
				<a href="https://www.fivepercentbook.com/" target="_blank">
					<img src="styles/books/five.png"/>
					The Five Percent</a>
				<b>(Peter Coleman, 2011)</b>
				<span style="display:block; height:5px"></span>
				The previous books were more general-theory-ish,
				but in this book, the author &mdash;
				in collaboration with peacemakers and social psychologists &mdash;
				applies complexity to the world's big “intractable problems”:
				civil war, cycles of violence, political deadlock, etc.
				Good stuff.
				</p>

				<p class="further_book">
				<a href="http://worrydream.com/MediaForThinkingTheUnthinkable/" target="_blank">
					<img src="styles/books/media.png"/>
					Media For Thinking The Unthinkable</a>
				<b>(Bret Victor, 2013)</b>
				<span style="display:block; height:5px"></span>
				Okay, this one’s not a book, it’s a talk.
				And it’s not about complexity itself,
				but how we can use interactive media to <i>wrestle with</i> complexity!
				Computers, not to replace human intuition and imagination,
				but to <i>enhance</i> them.
				<br><br>
				Bret Victor's interactive works (like
				<a href="http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/" target="_blank">this</a>,
				<a href="http://worrydream.com/LadderOfAbstraction/" target="_blank">this</a>, and
				<a href="http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/" target="_blank">this</a>)
				are a huge inspiration to me,
				and this talk of his
				captures the guiding philosophy behind <i>Simulating The World</i>.
				</p>

				<p class="further_book">
				<a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/emotica/" target="_blank">
					<img src="styles/books/emotica.png"/>
					Emotica Online!</a>
				<b>(Anna Anthropy, 2015)</b>
				<span style="display:block; height:5px"></span>
				...and here's where I got the idea to make worlds in emoji.
				</p>

				<div class="appendix_title" style="font-size:57px; line-height:50px; margin-top:50px">PLEASE BOTHER ME</div>

				(Might I recommend <a href="https://ncase.me/polygons" target="_blank">Parable of the Polygons</a>?
				It’s a social-system simulation I made a year ago,
				in collaboration with Vi Hart,
				about discrimination &amp; diversity!)

				<p>
				Anyway, thank you so much for (playing/reading?)
				Now let’s get out there, and show them systems what's what.

How To Run This On Your Own Computertron
---

Yeah basically just download this github repository, and host it on some local server. I use the minimalist [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server), but you can also use [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/). (*Simulating The World* is just a bunch of static files, but it needs to be on a server because of some weird browser security issues with XMLHttpRequests)

###Saving your own sims locally:

1. Get it running on your own computertron (see above). For the sake of this example, let's assume it's running on `http://localhost:8080/`. (which it will by default, if you use http-server)
2. Go to `http://localhost:8080/model`, and make your own sim!
3. Click "export model". Your simulation's data should pop up in a new tab.
4. Save it locally to `[your local folder]/model/models`, as `[your sim name].json`. (NOTE: the ".json" extension is important!)
5. Finally, to see your own sim in action, go to `http://localhost:8080/model?local=[your sim name]`! Voilà! And you can keep editing and exporting from there, just copy-paste the new data to `[your sim name].json`.

Other Peeps' Stuff I Used
---

They're all open source! Except for Firebase. Oh well.

**Code Stuff:**

* [MinPubSub](https://github.com/daniellmb/MinPubSub) - A tiny publish/subscribe library.
* [Perfect Scrollbar](http://noraesae.github.io/perfect-scrollbar/) - Custom scrollbars. Mostly because Mac OS X Lion is silly and hides all the scrollbars because 'minimalism'.
* [requestAnimationFrame shim](https://gist.github.com/paulirish/1579671) - A requestAnimationFrame polyfill.
* [reqwest](https://github.com/ded/reqwest) - A tiny XMLHttpRequest library.
* [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) - To save & load models from ☁️The Cloud☁️
* [Platform.js](https://github.com/bestiejs/platform.js) - To test browser/OS, because there is no good emoji feature detection arrrgghhhhhhhh

**Font Stuff:**

* [Sniglet](https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/sniglet) - For the title splash.
* [OpenSansEmoji](https://github.com/MorbZ/OpenSansEmoji) - Fallback font if your browser doesn't support emoji.
